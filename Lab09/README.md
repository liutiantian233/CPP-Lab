# The Lab Problem

We are going to work on making our own data structures using a C++ `struct`. Specifically, we are going to create both data members and member functions. We are going to make a 2D `MathVector struct`. Keep it straight, these are the mathematical entitles called Vectors (a geometric entity with direction and magnitude).

# Some Background

So if you don't remember, here is a little background on two-dimensional vectors.

A vector is basically an arrow that has a magnitude (a length) and a direction (an angle with respect to typically the x axis). It usually is represented as an x, y pair, where the origin of the vector is assumed to be at 0, 0 and the head of the vector is as the listed x, y pair.
