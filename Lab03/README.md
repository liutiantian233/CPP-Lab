# Lab Assignment

## Background

You remember calculus don't you? The basic concept of an integral is the area under the curve, the curve represented by some function. If you can integrate a function, you can calculate that area directly, but for some functions it is easier to approximate that area using discrete, iterative methods. We are going to investigate one of those methods, the [Trapezoid Rule](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapezoidal_rule).
